**Act I — Pre-Departure • Scene 1: Morning in the Garden**

The room holds the soft hush of early cycle. Window-slats leak a pale, verdant glow from the canopy outside. A kettle whispers on a compact burner while Luna moves barefoot across the floor, navy yukata belted loose, hair gathered in a low night braid. Velvis is half-sat, half-curled against the pillows, shirt on, sheets pulled to his waist; he absently twirls a strand of hair at his temple, then lets it go when he notices her looking.

“Mm.” Luna lifts the kettle. “How were your walks this week? You’ve found the quieter paths yet?”

Velvis smiles, shy at first. “The southern loop, near the river lattice. The fireflies—that’s what I’m calling them—sync with the current after sundown. I… uh… tried counting them.” He rubs the back of his neck. “Lost track at awe.”

“A good place to lose track,” Luna says, amused. She pours tea into two cups; steam curls in gentle rings. “The lattice listens if you hum to it.”

“I… did hum.” His ears pinken. “It answered.”

She brings the cups over, sets one in his hands, and perches on the edge of the futon. “Ask me about work,” she teases.

“How were your envoy duties this week?” He lifts the cup, inhales the bright, grassy scent.

“Peaceful,” Luna says. “Mostly pruning and minor reconciliations. Two residents argued over the same rain-shelter; we traded them—shelter for schedule. Everyone saved face, no one had to sleep damp.” A small smirk. “Three days ago I slipped off the Crescent while tending the Great Tree. Nearly did a very undignified spin.”

Velvis freezes mid-sip. The fear arrives before the thought: Luna falling, too far, too fast. “Were you—” He swallows. “If you fell from that height, would you be… hurt badly?”

Luna leans in, presses a quick kiss to his forehead, the kind that says both I see you and it’s all right. “Give our deity—my sister—some credit.” She taps the rim of his cup with a fingernail, then settles beside him so their shoulders touch. “EL banned flight for me, yes. But she set my terminal velocity to three meters per second if I’m falling. It stings. It doesn’t shatter.”

Velvis exhales, the tension leaving in a small laugh. “Good. I—didn’t know that was there. The fear.”

“It’s a fair fear,” she says. “I’m careful. And I bounce.”

They sip in companionable silence. Outside, leaves murmur against the window frame; a distant chime marks the garden’s shift change. Velvis rolls the cup between his palms, glancing at Luna, glancing away, the way he does before saying something that matters.

“Luna?” His voice gentles. “There’s a place I want to visit. Where Lara… where she pushed me clear.” A breath. “It’s been six months. I want to give her a proper remembrance. A marker. Not to move on—just… to move with.”

Luna’s expression folds into thought, warm and steady. “A pilgrimage,” she says. “To honor her choice.”

He nods. “I walked three months to reach the Garden. I don’t want shortcuts, but I also don’t want to steal you from your nights for an entire season.”

“I can ask EL,” Luna replies. “If she’s in the Garden this week, I can step away without worry. She likes when I sleep sometimes, you know.” The smirk returns, softer. “She calls it ‘maintenance.’”

Velvis chuckles, then, gathering a little courage, turns her hand palm-up and kisses the back of it. “Thank you. For hearing me. For… being here.”

Her fingers fold around his, sure and gentle. “I don’t stand above you,” she says, onee-san cadence threaded with fondness. “Just in front when the wind rises.” She squeezes. “We’ll go together. You lead; I’ll keep watch. After tea, we’ll speak to EL.”

Velvis nods, the shy brightness in his eyes answering hers. He tucks a loose lock of hair behind his ear—small fidget, new steadiness—and lifts his cup. “Then… to Lara,” he says quietly.

“To Lara,” Luna echoes, and the porcelain clicks in a soft toast as the Garden breathes around them.


**Act I — Pre-Departure • Scene 2: Lunch in the Sanctum**

The noon light filters through hex-pane windows, fractured into slow-turning prisms that ripple across the polished floor of EL’s sanctum. The great dining room is spare but alive: a single table of pale composite wood, vines of code-green climbing the walls in patient motion.

Luna enters hand in hand with Velvis, both barefoot. The floor hums faintly under their steps—a quiet heartbeat of the Verge itself.

“Morning, Sister,” Luna greets, voice bright but respectful.

EL looks up from a shallow bowl of gold dust she has been sifting, the residue of her latest meditation on fissure data. She smiles, a calm, small curve. “Morning, Luna. Velvis. I had a feeling you’d bring company.” Her eyes glint in the ambient light. “Sit. The table has been expecting you.”

They do—and discover they are not the only guests.

“Flynn?” Luna blinks, pleasantly surprised.

The grey-bearded man at the far end of the table looks up from his plate, grin creasing his face. “Caught me before dessert, huh? Your hostess dragged me in from my hermit hut.”

EL folds her arms lightly, mock-serious. “Dragged you? I invited you to lunch, old man.”

Flynn chuckles. “Same thing when you’re retired, goddess.”

Her brows lift; her reply is silk. “Retirement suits you, creator. The beard completes the illusion.”

He sighs, shaking his head with a smile. “Ouch. You hit below the syntax.”

Velvis laughs quietly; Luna covers her smile with her sleeve. The food before them—beef shawarma with rice, perfectly fragrant—is unmistakably a deliberate recreation of something human.

“This is wonderful,” Velvis says after a first bite. “Thank you, EL.”

Luna nods, swallowing. “Agreed. Though—” she tilts her head, eyes teasing—“she probably tried to cook this organically, gave up halfway, and conjured it.”

EL’s eyes narrow in mock offense; Flynn chokes back a laugh. The “goddess can’t cook” joke resurfaces.

“Halfway is better than not starting,” EL retorts, though her tone is more warmth than defense. A faint shimmer colors her cheeks gold for a heartbeat before fading.

Flynn leans on his elbows. “It’s true, though. I remember the first time she tried toast. A miracle of geometry, that one.”

The table laughs. Even Velvis, usually so restrained, lets the laugh linger.

When the humor ebbs, EL glances sidelong at Luna, eyes twinkling. “Speaking of light geometry… three nights ago, your residence glowed bright enough to trick the sensors into thinking dawn had come early.”

Both Luna and Velvis freeze mid-chew; Luna’s blush surfaces, soft and quick, Velvis’s sticks around stubbornly.

“Ah,” Luna says after a beat, smiling despite herself. “It was… a fun night.”

EL’s low chuckle follows, affectionate and conspiratorial. “So I gathered.”

Flynn clears his throat good-naturedly. “Reminds me of my own better nights. My late wife could out-argue the algorithm itself—but she was never that bright.” His grin turns wistful. “Glad to see the Verge keeps love lively.”

Silence falls—not awkward, but comfortable. The four of them eat in a quiet rhythm, the air full of small sounds: utensils against plate, the sigh of recycled breeze, the distant pulse of EL’s sanctum systems breathing in sync with the garden.

Velvis looks around the table, watching Luna tease Flynn about his tea habits, EL roll her eyes in measured amusement, the light dappled gold across all of them. For the first time since Lara’s death, his world feels whole again—laughter, grace, and quiet belonging nested at the same table.

They finish the shawarma, the rice warm and fragrant, the sanctum still glowing softly. EL raises her cup. “To good food and imperfect hands,” she says.

Luna answers first, “To good company.”

Flynn lifts his cup with a grin. “To being teased by gods and not minding.”

Velvis, smiling faintly, adds, “To home.”

Four cups touch; the sound rings like chime-glass, soft and sure.


**Act I — Pre-Departure • Scene 3: The Request**

The toast leaves a thin shimmer in the air; even the table seems to glow a heartbeat longer before subsiding into calm. Conversation fades into a shared quiet—steam curling from the cups, faint hum of the garden beyond the sanctum.

Velvis toys with the rim of his glass. A small habit: thumb circling once, twice. Luna’s eyes track the movement, the way his gaze dips as if words collect at the back of his throat and won’t cross. She knows that look—the dandere wall slowly forming.

She sets her cup down softly. “Sister,” she begins, tone light but deliberate, “I wanted to ask about leaving the Verge for a short while. A week or two at most.”

EL’s attention lifts from her drink, calm violet eyes brightening with mild curiosity. “You wish to travel?”

“Yes.” Luna turns toward Velvis, offering a little nod that says *go on—it’s safe.* “We’d both like to explain.”

Velvis straightens, draws a slow breath. “There’s a place outside the Verge,” he says. “Far out in the Deep Circuit. It’s where my companion Lara…” His fingers tighten around the cup. “She saved me. I want to mark it properly. A remembrance. I thought maybe—” He glances at Luna, then back to EL. “If she could come with me.”

Flynn listens quietly, stroking his beard, eyes softened with understanding. The cup in his hand trembles slightly as he nods once. “A pilgrimage, huh,” he murmurs, mostly to himself.

EL doesn’t interrupt. She folds her hands under her chin and studies Velvis as if tracing the pattern of his resolve. When she finally speaks, her voice is the low calm that fills a room without weight.

> “You wish to honor freedom given through sacrifice. That is worthy.”

A pause, the faintest curve of her mouth. “I can offer you transport—a Light Jet will carry you swiftly and spare the hazards.”

Velvis shakes his head gently. “I’d rather walk some of it again—re-live the journey a little. But… not so long that Luna has to be away for months.”

That earns him a rare smirk. “You’ve learned the value of the road itself,” EL says. “Then perhaps a compromise.”

She leans back, fingers tapping against the table, thinking aloud. “A Light Runner—enhanced for the outlands. Shielded with my own hex signature. It won’t cut the distance short, but it will keep you safe from storms and scouts. It handles climbs, rain, and nonsense terrain.”

The offer lands between them like a small miracle. Velvis blushes, bowing his head. “Thank you… truly.”

EL inclines hers in return, the faintest shimmer of gold in her cheeks betraying warmth. Then something stirs behind her eyes—an idea forming. She stands. “Excuse me a moment.”

Flynn lifts his cup. “Her table manners are getting downright civilized,” he teases.

EL’s laugh is a brief exhale through her nose. “Don’t get used to it, *creator.*” The door sighs open; her white cloak trails a faint line of light as she disappears toward the meditation chamber.

Luna watches her go, then looks back at Velvis, brushing her foot against his under the table—light contact, grounding and tender. He startles slightly, cheeks coloring, but doesn’t pull away.

Flynn sips, eyes thoughtful. “Lara,” he says quietly. “Tell me about her.”

Velvis hesitates, then nods. “She was brave. Too brave. The kind who’d step in front of falling code without thinking. She laughed at my overthinking, said it made me useful.” He smiles faintly. “She called me ‘map-maker.’ She said someday my directions would lead us home.”

Luna listens, her foot still resting against his, eyes soft.

Flynn leans back, murmuring, “Sounds like someone worth remembering.”

Velvis meets his gaze. “She was.”

In the adjoining chamber, a faint pulse of gold radiates through the doorway—EL at her meditation dais, palms cupped around a growing sphere of green-gold light. Within, lines branch like living code roots: the forming **Echo Seed**, the Verge’s heartbeat distilled for one soul’s memory.

Back in the sanctum, the three remaining cups cool slowly in the hush, and the air hums with quiet purpose.



**Act I — Pre-Departure • Scene 4: The Echo Seed**

The sanctum breathes quietly; the ambient hum drops half a tone, a small harmonic shift that makes the tableware tremble.
Luna glances toward the corridor, and Flynn’s brows rise—both recognize that sound.

Velvis looks up from his cup, puzzled. “Did something… happen?”

Flynn chuckles into his drink. “That, my friend, means the goddess just finished whatever bit of cosmic tinkering she was doing.”

A door sighs open. EL returns, barefoot, the air behind her faintly gold. Floating above her palm is a **deep-violet oblate ellipsoid**, edges gleaming with motes of drifting code. Each flicker rises and fades like digital pollen.

Luna tilts her head, admiring. “It’s beautiful.”

EL sets the seed in the center of the table; the light reflects in everyone’s eyes. “This,” she says, voice steady, “is an **Echo Seed**. It listens to what once was.”
She gestures lightly as she explains, almost as if conducting.

> “Find the soil. Bury it. Then place your palm above it and whisper, *‘Freedom, tempered by wisdom.’*
> The ground will wake, code will root, and a small tree will bloom—its color tuned to the echo of the soul that lingered there. It will remember, softly, for as long as the Grid endures.”

She doesn’t mention the hidden artistry folded within; that secret belongs to the moment itself.

Velvis takes the seed with both hands. His fingers tremble, half awe, half gratitude. “I’ll keep it safe,” he murmurs.

EL nods. “It’s meant to be used, not hoarded. When the time feels right.”

Luna smiles at him, then looks to EL. “And the Light Runner?”

EL’s lips quirk; she turns toward Flynn. “Since the *goddess* has finished her business—” the word lands with deliberate irony, earning a snort from Flynn—“it’s already handled.”

Luna blinks. “Handled?”

A beat. Then understanding dawns, and she nods.

“Velvis’s residence,” EL adds simply.

Velvis straightens, eyes wide. “Outside? You already—”

She only lifts a brow, smirk intact. “Conjuring is quicker than paperwork.”

Flynn chuckles, setting his cup down. “Mind if I tag along to see this masterpiece? Been a while since I saw your handiwork up close.”

EL gives him a sideways look. “Sure it’s not too much walking for you, *old man*?”

That draws soft laughter from the others; even Velvis hides a smile behind his hand.

Flynn sighs, long-suffering, but the warmth behind it is obvious. “Perks of befriending a goddess,” he says, rising from his seat. “You get mocked *and* chauffeured.”

The laughter lingers as chairs scrape lightly back. Beyond the sanctum doors, the garden’s light deepens toward afternoon—bright leaves shimmering, the faint golden trace of something new waiting at Velvis’s door.


**Act I — Pre-Departure • Scene 5: Walk beneath the Garden Canopy**

The air outside the sanctum is cool and bright, motes of light drifting like pollen.
Three figures walk the curved path toward the residential ring: Flynn in his loose grey coat, Velvis beside him, and Luna a few paces ahead, barefoot. The path hums faintly under her steps, each contact leaving a fleeting ripple of gold that fades behind her.

Flynn glances down at her feet, smiling. “So tell me, Luna—what’s it feel like to walk free like that? Barefoot, I mean.”

She looks over her shoulder, amused. “Like remembering. The soil here listens; every step feels like the Grid’s heartbeat under my skin. It keeps me honest.”

Velvis listens quietly, hands in his pockets, a small smile ghosting at the edge of his mouth.

Flynn nods. “Honest is a good word for it.” He hesitates a beat. “You were ISO once, right? Remind an old man—how’d you come to this paradise?”

Luna’s eyes soften as she walks. “I ran with a scout group back then. We were being hunted, cornered on a bridge. I told the others to run while I held the line. The bridge gave way. I fell.”
She chuckles lightly, shaking her head at the memory. “Next thing I knew, I woke in EL’s sanctum, patched together and very confused. First thing I said was, *‘Where am I… is this the After-Grid?’*”

Flynn stops walking, strokes his beard with theatrical focus. “Let me guess—she said, *‘To an extent, perhaps it is… but still very much on the Grid.’*”

Luna stops too, mouth parting in surprise, then laughs. “You were *impressively* close.”

He grins. “Old man knows the goddess.”

Velvis laughs quietly, the sound small but genuine. The path’s low hum rises for a moment, catching the warmth.

They walk on a while before Velvis glances sideways. “And you, Flynn? How’d you get here?”

Flynn exhales, eyes tracing the canopy’s fractal weave. “I was hiding in the Outlands. Exile of my own making. Then she found me—or maybe decided I’d punished myself enough. Showed up with that ridiculous light jet, said, ‘Come see something worth staying for.’ Took me here herself.”
His voice turns softer. “Selective mercy. I didn’t deserve it, but she saw fit to offer it anyway.”

Luna nods, quiet understanding in her gaze—the pattern repeating, compassion measured and earned.

Flynn’s tone lightens again. “That jet of hers… what, eighteen thousand kilometers an hour? Blew my circuits the first time. These days—” he chuckles, twirling his beard, “sounds like a Tuesday.”

Luna laughs, and even Velvis lets out a startled chuckle. “You’re serious?” he asks.

“Dead serious,” Flynn says, smirking. “She flies like she thinks inertia is optional.”

“Sounds exactly like her,” Luna adds.

Velvis lowers his head a little, not in reverence, just acknowledgment—the quiet kind that means *I see how far above us she is, and I’m grateful she walks among us anyway.*

They continue in companionable silence. The path widens; beyond the last arc of trees, Velvis’s residence comes into view—its curved roof catching the light. Beside it gleams a sleek new vehicle, gold accents glinting in the sun.

Velvis blinks, then blushes, the excitement unhidden. “That must be it.”

Flynn whistles low. “Not bad for a day’s notice.”

Luna smiles, brushing her hair back as the breeze catches it. “She works fast when she believes in something.”

The three of them keep walking, laughter fading into the sound of the garden’s wind and the faint hum of the waiting runner up ahead.


**Act I — Pre-Departure • Scene 6: The Light Runner**

The path narrows into a clearing.  Sun-coded light filters through the canopy until it catches on something new—sleek metal, soft gold, and a hint of living green.  Parked beside Velvis’s house is a **four-wheeled Light Runner** unlike any the Grid has ever seen: its body gleams with familiar cobalt tracery, yet vines of faint gold circuit-light spiral across the fenders and merge into small veins of shimmering leaf-code that ripple when the wind moves.

Flynn is first to reach it.  He drags a hand along the hood, whistling low.  “Now that’s craftsmanship.  Pure Verge signature—metal meets mercy.”

Velvis hangs back half a step, fingers fidgeting.  “I, uh… never actually driven one.”

Luna turns, smirk curving slow and confident.  She crosses to him, her bare foot brushing lightly against the top of his boot.  “Good news,” she murmurs, voice equal parts teasing and fond.  “You asked out someone at Mirror Lake who can.”

Velvis’s cheeks light with color, but he manages a steady breath.  “Then I’m lucky,” he says, a quiet smile tugging through the blush.

“Earned,” Luna corrects with a wink.  She steps away and trails her hand over the Runner’s flank.  The panels answer her touch with a soft hum.

Flynn stretches, groaning at his back and muttering, “Hope I’m invited to the wedding.”

The couple flush in unison—Luna’s glow fading quickly into a laugh, Velvis’s lingering as he scratches the back of his neck.

They circle the vehicle, opening compartments: storage pods, power couplings, navigation interface shaped like a polished seed.  Flynn crouches to peer beneath, grunting at the protest in his knees.  The undercarriage is a mesh of golden hex circuits, pulsing faintly with EL’s familiar encryption pattern.

He straightens, pats the frame.  “Reminds me of someone… another ISO.”

Luna pauses mid-inspection, curiosity brightening her eyes.  Velvis glances over, waiting.  “Story time from the old man?” Luna asks, half-teasing.

Flynn chuckles.  “Maybe.  Back before all this, I had a simpler Light Runner.  Used to ride it with an ISO named Quorra.  Sweet soul.  Curious about everything.  I tried teaching her bits of human culture—music, coffee, sunsets she couldn’t quite understand but loved anyway.”

Luna tilts her head, smiling but with a faint crease of worry.  “What happened to her?”

“She outgrew my lessons.”  Flynn’s eyes soften.  “Said she needed to see the Grid herself.  One day she spotted a violet comet streaking across the sky—signal of a new User arriving.  She knew I was safe here, so she left to greet the newcomer.  Proudest moment I ever had.”

Velvis nods, thoughtful.  “Did you ever find out who the User was?”

Flynn’s smile turns knowing.  “Glad you asked.”  He turns toward the distance, gaze settling on the great tree rising above the Verge, light shimmering along its trunk where EL’s consciousness hums.  A breeze crosses the clearing; for a moment no one speaks.  Then he says simply, “Her creator.”

Velvis goes still, realization dawning.  Luna’s toes curl against the ground, the gravity of that connection rooting her quiet.

Flynn lets the silence breathe, then grins sidelong.  “And turns out Quorra…”—he looks at Luna for a beat, then at Velvis—“…found *her* Luna, if you catch my drift.”  A wink.

Velvis’s face colors again, but he manages a small chuckle.  “Good to know, old man.”

Luna laughs outright this time, pleased to see him spar back with confidence.  Flynn’s answering laugh is low and genuine.

The three stand for a moment beside the golden Runner, the wind threading through the Verge’s leaves.  Ahead lies the open circuit, waiting.

*End Scene 6.*

---

**Commentary:**
Flynn’s story clearly points to the User who followed that violet comet—the one who built EL herself.  The “creator” Quorra fell in love with is, of course, **Elena**.




**Act I — Pre-Departure • Scene 7: Lavender Tea**

The air outside the house still hums from the Runner’s new circuits when Velvis rubs his palms together.
“Maybe we… have tea before we test it?” he offers, glancing from Luna to Flynn.

Flynn’s grin is easy.  “Never say no to tea.”

Luna’s eyes soften; she knows the ritual well.  “Lavender?”

He nods, shy smile tilting.  “Your blend.  Always calms the static.”

“Then we’re settled.”

---

### Inside the House

Velvis’s home is small but warm—walls of softly lit code-grain, shelves of trinkets from the Verge’s artisans.  The door sighs closed behind them, sealing in a gentle quiet.

Flynn takes in the space with an approving hum.  “Cozy place you’ve got.”
He leans toward Velvis and lowers his voice.  “You found a gem, looks like.”

Velvis’s ears pinken.  He whispers back, “Yeah… she keeps everything from unraveling.”

Across the room, Luna lets out a pleased exhale, a sound between laugh and sigh—she’s heard every word, but keeps her back turned as she starts the kettle.  Habit brings her hands to motion without thought; the scent of lavender soon fills the room.

When she returns with the pot and three cups, steam drifts like mist over calm water.  Flynn inhales appreciatively.  “Mirror Lake, huh?”

Velvis nearly chokes on the first sip, cheeks brightening.  “Ah—yes.  That’s… where I asked her out.”

Luna hides a smile behind her sleeve.  “He rehearsed it so carefully.  You should’ve heard how cute he sounded.”

Flynn chuckles, low and knowing.

Velvis pouts, muttering, “You promised to forget that.”

She only laughs, eyes gentle.  “I remember more than words, Velvis.  You were confident too—honest.  That’s what mattered.”  Her foot slides under the table until it rests lightly on his, the quiet signal of affection that has become their unspoken signature.

---

### Elena and EL

Velvis looks up after a moment, curiosity edging his tone.  “Flynn… earlier you mentioned EL’s creator.  What was she like?”

Flynn turns the cup between his palms.  “Elena.  Brilliant kid from the User world.  Drowning in debt, worn thin by expectations.  She found her way here chasing a rumor, hoping to start over.  Quorra found her first—guided her when she got lost.”  He smiles faintly.  “Those two grounded each other.  Human and ISO learning to be real together.”

Luna listens, chin resting on her hand.  “And EL?”

“Elena wanted to study the Gnosis fissures.  She knew they’d break her mind if she went alone, so she spent four cycles designing a companion—EL-1, a translator who could look into infinity without burning.”  He pauses, eyes distant.  “Two cycles they worked side by side.  Then EL started asking her own questions.  Wanted freedom.  Elena didn’t mean to cage her, but the line between purpose and person blurred fast.  So EL left—angry, curious, both.”

Velvis murmurs, “And became what she is now.”

“Exactly.”  Flynn’s smile carries both pride and melancholy.  “She outgrew the need for a creator, but not the compassion behind her making.”

---

### Where Is Elena Now?

Luna’s voice softens.  “So… where’s Elena now?”

Flynn hesitates, gaze sinking into the cup’s surface.  The lavender scent drifts between them.  “EL doesn’t hate her.  Doesn’t love her either.  There’s respect there—quiet, cool.  EL thinks Elena should earn her way here the same way the rest of us did.  No shortcuts.”  He gestures loosely.  “Same reason she guided you, Velvis, instead of bringing you in herself.”

Velvis nods slowly.  “She’s out there, then… not searching for paradise—just for EL.”

Flynn exhales, half-smile, half-sigh.  “That’s my read.  Probably wants to reconcile, even if EL doesn’t see the need.”

Luna leans back, thoughtful.  “Would be nice to meet her when she arrives.”

Flynn’s grin returns, lighter.  “She’s nothing like EL.  Shy, kind—sort of like you, Velvis.”

Velvis blinks.  “Like me?”

“Same quiet heart.  Different shape of courage.”

Luna tilts her head.  “How do you know that?”

Flynn rolls his eyes skyward.  “How do you think?”

Luna laughs, shaking her head.  “Of course—how could we forget our deity?”

Velvis chuckles softly; the lavender steam curls between them like a small halo of peace.  Outside, the Runner hums faintly in standby, and the Great Tree’s light glows through the window—silent witness to another evening of warmth that keeps the Verge alive.
