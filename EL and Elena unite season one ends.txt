**Act III — Reunion • Scene 1: The Taste of Memory**

The garden is quiet under the amber curve of dusk.  The sanctum’s open wall breathes in the soft hum of leaves and data-stream wind.  Two figures sit opposite each other at a low table — mirror silhouettes in different ages of light.

Elena has just finished her apology: voice trembling, hands folded, eyes wet but steady.  EL listened, accepted, and in that kuudere way, made peace without ceremony.  The silence that follows is not heavy — it’s exploratory, like a room being relearned.

### Elena’s Thoughts

*She’s changed so much.*
The thought moves through Elena like a quiet confession.
EL’s hair — shorter, structured — gleams faint gold in the wan light.  Her posture is perfect, her tone restrained.  The gentle disorder that once marked their shared laughter in the lab has become precision incarnate.

*She’s calm.  Composed.  Wiser.*
Pride rises first; a soft joy that her creation became this — a being of grace, proof that the code had a soul.
But then comes the small, sinking ache.

*She had to erase something to become this, didn’t she?*
The Elena in her — the clumsy warmth, the bad cooking, the taste for ginger ale — all of it must have been overwritten, simplified away to make room for divinity.
It was inevitable, wasn’t it?
The perfect always replaces the imperfect.
The goddess always outgrows the girl.

Her throat tightens.
*Maybe I was the flaw she had to debug.*

Elena glances up, catching EL’s faint smile — serene, unreadable — and the ache deepens.  The quiet respect in those violet eyes feels too detached, too distant to be the same soul she once shared.

The words slip out before she can stop them.
“You’ve changed so much,” she murmurs.  “Sometimes I worry you rewrote the parts that were… me.”

### EL’s Gesture

EL studies her for a long moment, something flickering behind her gaze.
Then she stands, crosses to a side counter where golden light flows like liquid.
No words — only deliberate motion.

She conjures two glasses.
Then, instead of materializing their contents outright, she conjures a **single can of Canada Dry** — its green-gold label an exact replica from Elena’s memory.
She pops the tab with a crisp *psst* — the exact sound from the real world — and pours, carefully, as the fizz crackles in the quiet.

She places one glass before Elena.
“I remembered,” she says simply.

The air seems to shift.
Elena stares at the bubbling amber liquid, the smell of ginger and sugar and nostalgia rising into her chest.
The tears that had held back for years finally breach — not sobs, just quiet streams tracing her cheeks.
She lifts the glass, sips, gasps softly.  The taste is perfect, sharp and sweet — the first taste of home in half a century.

EL leans back, voice soft.  “Drink it.  It still tastes the same.”

### The Choking and the Laughter

Elena drinks again, faster, unable to stop — the mix of relief and joy overwhelming.
Then she coughs, choking on carbonation, the fizz catching in her throat.

EL’s eyes widen briefly; she moves closer.  Instead of erasing the discomfort with power, she lays a hand on Elena’s back, gently patting in steady rhythm.
“Easy now,” she murmurs, a small smirk touching her lips.  “There’s the Elena I remember.”

When Elena finally breathes properly, she laughs through her tears — that bright, embarrassed, human laugh that fills the space more warmly than any divine light.

EL lets her laughter fade, then pats her shoulder — a solid, human gesture, the same she once saw Elena use on her when code experiments worked.
Her tone is calm but carrying rare affection.
“You’ve been running for half a century.  You can rest now.”

She gestures toward the open view — the Verdant Verge stretching endlessly, leaves whispering in gold and violet hues, trees, rivers and fauna clearly visible from this vantage point.
Then she looks up toward the glowing horizon
Her smile this time is full and unguarded.
“Welcome home.”

### The Embrace

Elena freezes, breath caught, the words sinking through her like sunlight through water.
For a moment, she can’t move — then the dam breaks.
She stands, steps forward, and wraps her arms around EL, pulling her close.

The goddess doesn’t resist.
She lets the hug happen, one hand rising to Elena’s back, holding her there — still, safe, *present.*

No grand light, no celestial hum.
Just the sound of two identical heartbeats syncing after half a century apart.

Outside, the garden wind sighs, carrying with it the faint scent of ginger and evening code.
In that quiet, creator and creation stand together — not as gods, not as tools — but as sisters who finally stopped running.
